### Node Watch

**Node Watch** is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a seamless development experience for JavaScript projects by enabling live reload functionality. It allows you to monitor changes in your JavaScript files and automatically restarts the Node.js server as you modify your code.

### Features

- **Live Reload**: Automatically restarts the Node.js server when changes are detected in your JavaScript files.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Utilizes the VS Code terminal to manage and display server output.
- **User-Friendly Commands**: Start and stop the Node.js server with simple commands directly from the command palette.

### Installation
